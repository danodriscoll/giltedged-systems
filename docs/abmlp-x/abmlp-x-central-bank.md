# ABMLP-X Central Bank

Last, but not least, the Central Bank agent responds in every model step; setting the interest rate on interest bearing money instruments (bills). Profits on the holding of bills previously purchased, if any, are returned to the Government. New cash money supplied to Households by the Central Bank is simply equal to the amount of bills purchased by the Central Bank.

        It's Monday 3rd of June 1822: Tensions run high at the ABMLP-X Central Bank monetary policy committee pre-meeting. For one-hundred and three years the interest rate on bills held at 5 percent. It was time for change. A recommended drop of 100 basis points. Who would inform the Governor?

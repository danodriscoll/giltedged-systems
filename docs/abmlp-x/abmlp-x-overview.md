# ABMLP-X Overview

Agent-Based Model Liquidity Preference-X (ABMLP-X) is an interpretation - an open ended development - of the third sectoral system described by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie (G&L) in their book [Monetary Economics](https://www.giltedged.info/reading#monetary-economics).

ABMLP-X comprises one Government, one Central Bank and many, possibly hundreds of Producers and Households. The parameters set by the Government and Central Bank - the inputs and outputs to the system - are modelled as a logical framework of accounting connecting the behaviours of sectoral agents.

## Test Output: Steady State System

The Hugging Face space, [abmlp-x-test](https://danodrisc-abmlp-test.hf.space), shows a simple test output of ABMLP-X. For an ABMLP-X model run that consumes real-world economic time series, view a [UK Static Perspective](https://www.giltedged.info/gilt-edged-mini/uk-static-perspective).

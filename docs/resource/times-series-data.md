### Financial Calendar Year

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) defines the UK’s financial quarters based on the calendar year:

* Q1: January to March  
* Q2: April to June  
* Q3: July to September  
* Q4: October to December

These quarterly divisions are used in ONS publications to report economic statistics.

It's important to note that while the ONS uses calendar quarters for economic reporting, the UK government operates on a financial year that runs from April 1 to March 31 of the following year. This financial year is also divided into four quarters:

* Q1: April to June  
* Q2: July to September  
* Q3: October to December  
* Q4: January to March

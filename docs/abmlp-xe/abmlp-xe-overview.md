# ABMLP-XE

*ABMLP-Extended-(X) and Enhanced(E)*

> "... the world&apos;s problems of which are serious will not be solved by market forces alone or even principally by them. Something else has to be done."
> 
> Wynne Godley, <cite>Interview on the life and work of Wynne Godley</cite>. Filmed in May 2008 by Alan Macfarlane and edited by Sarah Harrison. Apollo - University of Cambridge Repository. http://www.dspace.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/198374 Part 2, [01:03:10 - 01:03:30].

This fascinating interview concluded shortly after Wynne Godley made his thought-provoking statement, meaning he unfortunately never spoke in this interview on what *else* he thought *had to be done*. A new, simplified or updated core monetary system perhaps? I'll never know.

The [latest model](/category/abmlp-x-structure) strives to be a highly-simplified interpretation of the current institutional and accounting arrangements of the English government money system. Generic term-defined money instruments are issued at interest. ABMLP-XE supersedes ABMLP-X's conventional gilt-based framework. The operational flow and logic of ABMLP-XE is a purely conceptual exercise \- not expected to ever be a highly simplified representation of a real-world UK monetary system. Nevertheless, the system's development and new(ish) instrument structures might still hold value and interest.

# ABMLP-XE

*ABMLP-Extended-(X) and Enhanced(E)*

Longer term, ABMLP-X could form the foundational core from which to build the operational flow and underlying logic of an enhanced stock-flow consistent model of the UK government money system. ABMLP-XE is specifically intended to supersede the conventional gilt-based framework. While ABMLP-XE will never be a highly simplified representation of the UK monetary system, its development may still hold value and interest.
